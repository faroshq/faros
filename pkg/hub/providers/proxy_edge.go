// Org-scoped resolution and edge-fronted transport for the backend proxy.
//
// A platform provider is a URL the hub dials. An org-owned one is a workload in
// the tenant's own cluster, behind NAT, reachable only through the edge agent's
// reverse tunnel. Both are addressed as /services/providers/{name}/**, so the
// difference has to be resolved here.

// resolveProvider picks the copy of name that applies to this caller.
//
// The backend proxy resolves in the caller's Org first, so an Org that
// self-hosts a provider reaches its own. The UI proxy does not: it serves
// assets embedded in the hub or fetched from a platform URL, and an org's
// bundle is not something the hub hosts, so org-scoping there would only
// produce 404s where the platform asset used to work.
