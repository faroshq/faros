# Agents provider — multi-channel routing design

Status: **Implemented (2026-07-24).** Full named-channels + multi-inbound.
Backend (API types, outbound routing, multi-inbound `routeChannelAgent`, REST
handlers with inbound-uniqueness validation) and portal (Wiring-tab channel
editor, Flow-canvas multi-channel wiring, schedule/trigger channel dropdowns)
all built; module builds, vets, and tests pass; portal typechecks and builds.
Not yet driven end-to-end against a running hub.

## Summary

Today an agent binds to exactly **one** messaging channel. All proactive output
(schedule and heartbeat results, budget/error alerts, trigger output, approval
requests) is delivered through a single scalar field,
`AgentSpec.DefaultNotifyConnection`, and inbound messages are routed back to the
one agent whose `DefaultNotifyConnection` names the receiving Connection.

This design lifts an agent to **many named channels**. A user can give an agent
a *primary* comms channel (e.g. Telegram) plus secondary/tertiary channels (e.g.
a Discord `#incidents` room and a `#news` room), and route each schedule or
trigger to a specific channel. Example outcomes:

- A `daily-news` **cron schedule** posts to the `news` channel.
- An `incidents` **trigger** (webhook/GitHub) posts to a dedicated `incidents`
  channel with the on-call people.
- The user can **talk to the agent** from *both* Telegram and Discord, not just
  one.

The change is **additive and backward-compatible**: an existing agent with only
`DefaultNotifyConnection` set keeps working unchanged, treated as a single
`primary` channel.

## Why this is a small change

The hard plumbing already exists:

- **Multiple `Connection` resources are already first-class.** An agent can
  already have several telegram/discord/slack Connections in its workspace; it
  just can't *bind* more than one for messaging.
- **The executor already supports per-job destination override.**
  `executor.Job.ReplyTarget` is stamped by the Discord gateway so a channel run
  replies to the exact room the user typed in
  ([`background.go`](../providers/agents/api/background.go), the
  `KindChannel` branch). This proves per-run routing works end-to-end; we
  generalize it to schedules and triggers.

The single-channel assumption is concentrated in **three** places:

1. `AgentSpec.DefaultNotifyConnection` — a scalar, one Connection
   ([`types_agent.go`](../providers/agents/apis/v1alpha1/types_agent.go)).
2. `ScheduleSpec` / `TriggerSpec` carry **no** destination — output always
   funnels to that scalar
   ([`types_schedule.go`](../providers/agents/apis/v1alpha1/types_schedule.go),
   [`types_trigger.go`](../providers/agents/apis/v1alpha1/types_trigger.go)).
3. Inbound routing reverse-maps **one** agent per Connection via that scalar
   (`routeChannelAgent` in
   [`channels_inbound.go`](../providers/agents/api/channels_inbound.go)) — which
   is why an agent can't receive on a second channel today.

## Resource model

### Agent gains a named-channel list

```go
// AgentSpec
//
// Channels binds named messaging channels to the agent. The channel marked
// Primary (or the first entry) is the default notify target for output that
// does not name a channel. Schedules and Triggers may target any channel by
// name. When Channels is empty, DefaultNotifyConnection is treated as an
// implicit "primary" channel.
// +optional
Channels []AgentChannel `json:"channels,omitempty"`

// DefaultNotifyConnection is DEPRECATED in favor of Channels. When Channels is
// set it is ignored; when Channels is empty it is synthesized as the primary
// channel. Retained for backward compatibility.
// +optional
// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
DefaultNotifyConnection string `json:"defaultNotifyConnection,omitempty"`

// AgentChannel binds one logical channel role to a messaging Connection.
type AgentChannel struct {
	// Name is the logical channel role referenced by schedules and triggers,
	// e.g. "primary", "incidents", "news".
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Required
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MinLength=1
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=63
	Name string `json:"name"`

	// ConnectionRef names the messaging Connection that backs this channel.
	// +kubebuilder:validation:Required
	// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=253
	ConnectionRef string `json:"connectionRef"`

	// Primary marks the default notify target. Exactly one channel should be
	// primary; if none is marked, the first entry is primary.
	// +optional
	Primary bool `json:"primary,omitempty"`
}
```

### Schedules and Triggers gain a channel selector

```go
// ScheduleSpec / TriggerSpec
//
// ChannelRef names the agent channel this schedule/trigger delivers to. Empty
// means the agent's primary channel.
// +optional
// +kubebuilder:validation:MaxLength=63
ChannelRef string `json:"channelRef,omitempty"`
```

`ChannelRef` is a **logical channel name** (from `Agent.Spec.Channels[].Name`),
not a Connection name. This decouples automation from the underlying integration
— re-point the `incidents` channel from Discord to Slack by editing the agent,
and every trigger routed to `incidents` follows, with no schedule/trigger edits.

### Resolution helper

A single resolver used everywhere output is sent:

```go
// resolveChannel returns the Connection name for a channel role on an agent.
// role=="" resolves to the primary channel. Falls back to DefaultNotifyConnection
// when Channels is empty. Returns ("", false) when nothing is configured.
func resolveChannel(agent *Agent, role string) (connName string, ok bool)
```

Rules:
- `Channels` empty → `DefaultNotifyConnection` (legacy path).
- `role == ""` → the `Primary` channel, else the first entry.
- `role != ""` → the channel with that `Name`; if not found, fall back to
  primary and log (don't drop the message silently).

## Routing changes

### Outbound (schedule / trigger / notify)

1. **Carry the destination on the job.** Add `Job.NotifyConnection string` to
   [`executor.Job`](../providers/agents/executor/executor.go), mirroring the
   existing `ReplyTarget`. Set at enqueue time by resolving the firing
   Schedule/Trigger's `ChannelRef` through `resolveChannel`.
2. **`background.notify` honors the job.** The notify branch in
   [`background.go`](../providers/agents/api/background.go) (schedule/heartbeat/
   trigger output and failure alerts) sends through `job.NotifyConnection` when
   set, else the agent's primary.
3. **Direct resolvers use primary.** The `notify` and `ask` tools
   ([`tools/core.go`](../providers/agents/tools/core.go)), toolset approval
   delivery ([`toolset.go`](../providers/agents/api/toolset.go)), and
   `deliverToNotifyChannel` ([`triggers.go`](../providers/agents/api/triggers.go))
   resolve `role==""` (primary) — unchanged behavior for the common case, now via
   the shared helper.

Channel *conversation* replies (`KindChannel`) are unaffected: they already
reply to the source connection via `ReplyTarget`.

### Inbound (multi-channel receive)

Rework `routeChannelAgent`
([`channels_inbound.go`](../providers/agents/api/channels_inbound.go)) so an
inbound message on Connection `C` routes to the agent that lists `C` as a
channel's `ConnectionRef`, instead of matching the single
`DefaultNotifyConnection` scalar:

```go
// order of precedence:
//   1. conn.Spec.Config["agent"]  (explicit override, unchanged)
//   2. the agent whose Channels[].ConnectionRef == conn.Name
//   3. legacy: the agent whose DefaultNotifyConnection == conn.Name
```

The per-connection inbound gate at the top of the webhook handlers
(`conn.Spec.Channel` must match the sender) and the Discord gateway's
`inConfigured` check remain per-Connection and need no change.

### Inbound verification, de-duplication, and quarantine

Status: **Implemented (2026-09-04)**, security remediation item 2.4.

The HMAC token in a channel webhook URL only proves the caller knows the URL,
and the URL is shown in the portal and pasted into Slack's dashboard. Because
an inbound message drives a tool-using agent as the user, every delivery must
also carry the platform's own proof. `webhookChannel`
([`channels_inbound.go`](../providers/agents/api/channels_inbound.go),
[`channels_verify.go`](../providers/agents/api/channels_verify.go)) now checks,
over the raw body and before parsing anything:

| Platform | Proof | Where the secret comes from |
|---|---|---|
| Slack | `X-Slack-Request-Timestamp` within 5 minutes of now, and `X-Slack-Signature == "v0=" + hex(HMAC-SHA256(secret, "v0:" + ts + ":" + body))`, compared constant-time. The `url_verification` handshake is signed too and is answered only after verification. | The Slack app **signing secret** (Slack app → Basic Information → App Credentials → Signing Secret), pasted as `signingSecret` on connection create/update; stored as `signing_secret` in `faros-agents-conn-<name>`. |
| Telegram | `X-Telegram-Bot-Api-Secret-Token` equals the stored secret (constant-time). | Generated by the provider (32 random bytes, hex) when the connection is created, stored as `signing_secret`, and sent as `secret_token` to `setWebhook`. |
| Discord | None needed: messages arrive over the bot's own token-authenticated gateway WebSocket, not a public HTTP endpoint. The provider exposes no interactions endpoint, so there is no Ed25519 callback to verify. | — |
| SMTP | Outbound only; there is no inbound mail path. | — |

A connection whose Secret has no `signing_secret` is refused with **401** and a
log line — there is no unverified grace mode. The background loop
([`channels_reconcile.go`](../providers/agents/api/channels_reconcile.go))
makes the state visible at startup and on every tick, for connections that
have inbound enabled (`status.webhookPath` set):

- **Slack** without a signing secret → `status.phase=Error`,
  `status.message="signing secret required; update the connection"`. Editing
  the connection and adding the signing secret (portal edit form, REST
  `signingSecret`, or the `update_connection` MCP tool) clears it.
  **Enable inbound** refuses to mint a URL for a Slack connection that has no
  signing secret yet.
- **Telegram** without a secret token → the provider generates one, stores
  it, reads the bot's currently registered webhook (`getWebhookInfo`) and
  re-registers it with `secret_token`. No user action; if the bot has no
  webhook any more (or it points elsewhere) the connection reports
  `Error` asking for **Enable inbound**, which now always registers with the
  secret.

**De-duplication.** Slack retries any delivery that did not get a 2xx within
3s (`X-Slack-Retry-Num`), Telegram redelivers until acknowledged, and a
resumed Discord gateway session can replay `MESSAGE_CREATE`. Each event is
keyed by its platform id — Slack `event_id` (fallback `event.ts@channel`),
Telegram `update_id`, Discord message id — namespaced by cluster and
connection, and kept in a bounded in-memory TTL set (`inboundDedup`, 1h,
20k keys). A repeat is acknowledged with 200 and does not run again; a retry
after the provider answered 503 is accepted because the key is released when
the job was not queued. The key is also the executor `Job.ID`, so a durable
backend can enforce it. The set is per process — multi-replica durability
(the store's run idempotency index, claimed before the job is accepted) is a
follow-up; the executor is single-replica today.

**Back-pressure instead of drops.** `executor.Submit` no longer drops a job
when the 64-slot queue is full: it waits for a slot until the caller's
context ends (the channel handler gives it 2.5s, under Slack's 3s retry
timer; `SubmitWait` caps it at 5s otherwise) and then returns
`ErrQueueFull`, which the handler maps to **503 + `Retry-After`** so the
platform redelivers. Queued jobs are still lost on restart; a durable queue
is a follow-up.

**Prompt quarantine.** A trigger webhook's payload is appended to the task
inside an explicit untrusted block (`quarantinePayload`,
[`quarantine.go`](../providers/agents/api/quarantine.go)): the same
hostile-data instruction App Studio uses for browser console output, a
`<<<BEGIN UNTRUSTED PAYLOAD eventType=… contentType=…>>>` marker carrying the
few structured fields the task may need, the body (64 KiB cap, end marker
escaped), and an end marker. Channel messages are the user's own chat turn and
are passed as the task text, not quarantined.

## Validation

- **Inbound uniqueness (the one real constraint).** A given Connection may be
  the inbound `ConnectionRef` of **at most one** agent — an inbound message must
  resolve to a single agent. Enforced when saving an Agent (reject if another
  agent already claims the Connection) with `config["agent"]` as the escape
  hatch. *Outbound* sharing is unrestricted: many schedules/triggers/agents may
  send to the same channel.
- **Channel names unique per agent**; `ChannelRef` on a schedule/trigger must
  match an existing channel name on its agent (warn + fall back to primary at
  delivery time rather than hard-failing a firing).
- **At most one `Primary`** per agent (default the first entry when none set).

## REST + portal

- **REST** ([`api/agents.go`](../providers/agents/api/agents.go),
  [`api/schedules.go`](../providers/agents/api/schedules.go),
  [`api/triggers.go`](../providers/agents/api/triggers.go)): agent create/update
  accept `channels[]` (keep accepting the legacy `notifyConnection` and map it to
  a primary channel); schedule/trigger create/update accept `channelRef`.
- **Portal**: a channel-list editor on the Agent form (add/remove rows: name +
  Connection picker + primary radio); a channel dropdown on the Schedule and
  Trigger forms, populated from the selected agent's channels, defaulting to
  primary.

## Codegen

Regenerate deepcopy and CRD YAML for the **agents provider module only**
(`providers/agents/`). Do **not** run the repo-wide `make crds` — it regenerates
the core `core.faros.sh` APIExport and drops orphaned schemas, hanging hub
bootstrap (see the standing warning in project memory).

## Migration & compatibility

No data migration. Existing agents have `Channels` empty and keep delivering
through `DefaultNotifyConnection` via the legacy fallback in `resolveChannel`.
Existing schedules/triggers have empty `ChannelRef` → primary → same behavior as
today. The portal can lazily upgrade an agent to the `Channels` model on first
edit (seed a `primary` channel from `DefaultNotifyConnection`).

## Effort

~1.5–2 days, phased:

| Phase | Work | Est. |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | API types (`AgentChannel`, `ChannelRef`), deepcopy, CRD regen | 0.5d |
| 2 | Outbound: `Job.NotifyConnection`, enqueue resolves `ChannelRef`, `background.notify` per-job, direct resolvers via helper | 0.5–1d |
| 3 | Multi-inbound `routeChannelAgent` rework + inbound-uniqueness validation | 0.5d |
| 4 | REST handlers + portal channel editor / dropdowns | 0.5–1d |

## Out of scope (possible follow-ups)

- Fan-out: one schedule delivering to *several* channels at once (model is
  one `ChannelRef` per source; would become `ChannelRefs []string`).
- Per-channel autonomy/tool policy (e.g. read-only in a public channel).
- Channel-scoped filters on inbound (only fire triggers from certain rooms).
